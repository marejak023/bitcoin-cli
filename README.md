# bitcoin-cli
_bitcoin-cli is a free and open-source discord bot for bitcoin related commands_

## How to use
If you want to call an command, just use the prefix ```btc-cli!``` + ```command```, f.e. ```btc-cli! getdifficulty```. Simple as that!

### List of commands
Currently available commands are: </br>
getdifficulty, getblockcount, latesthash, btcperblock, totalbtc, probability, hashestowin, nextretarget,
avgtxsize, avgtxvalue, interval, eta, avgtxnumber

## TODO list
- [ ] Create/find someone with server/computer/RPi, where is downloaded Bitcoin Core, for being able to call commands (due to using the https://www.blockchain.com/api/q 
API, there is a GLOBAL 10 seconds cooldown). This is currently most important thing of the project since it is the biggest issue
- [ ] Add command for searching on the bitcoin wiki (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page)
- [ ] Create a website
- [ ] Make new design
